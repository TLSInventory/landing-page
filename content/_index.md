# HTTPS/TLS monitoring

Outages from expired certificates are common occurence on todays internet. Wouldn't it be better to do prevent them, instead of fixing them only after your regular uptime monitoring sounds the alarm? This open-source project can help you prevent such outages.

But it's more than just an certificate expiration monitoring. It also allows you to **monitor how secure is your HTTPS configuration, if any new subdomains appeared for your domains, what certificates are used where, and more**.

This whole project is open-source with MIT license. It's comprised of multiple parts:

- [Backend](https://github.com/TLSInventory/backend) - where most of the magic happens - API, scanning, database
- [Frontend](https://github.com/TLSInventory/frontend) - web interface which consumes the API provided by backend.

and multiple few utilities, which are all tied together using Docker containers. For quickstart checkout the [Docker repository](https://github.com/TLSInventory/docker) and also take a look to the Readme in backends repository.
